Install whiskey: https://github.com/cloudkick/whiskey
npm install whiskey -g

Run all tests:
make OR make test

Run specific test:
make FILE=soft*

Run tests and output code coverage*:
make coverage

* to get code coverage working please install node-jscoverage
https://github.com/visionmedia/node-jscoverage

note: before tests are, the makefile chdirs into the lib directory...
      this is what allows for:
      var bagel = require('bagels/hard');

      instead of having to do require('../../lib/bagels/hard') from your tests
