  test.skip();

You have access to sinon sandbox methods for mocking, spying, and stubbing:
http://sinonjs.org/docs/#sandbox

  EG: test.mock(..), test.spy(..), test.stub(..)

* to get code coverage working please install node-jscoverage
https://github.com/visionmedia/node-jscoverage

note: before tests are run, the makefile chdirs into the lib directory...
      this is what allows for:

      var bagel = require('bagels/hard');

      instead of having to do:

      var bagel = require('../../lib/bagels/hard')

      from your tests
