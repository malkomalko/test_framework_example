npm install

Run all tests:
make OR make test

Run specific test:
make FILE=soft*

make coverage

* to get code coverage working please install node-jscoverage
https://github.com/visionmedia/node-jscoverage

note: before tests are run, the makefile chdirs into the lib directory...
      this is what allows for:

      var bagel = require('bagels/hard');

      instead of having to do:

      var bagel = require('../../lib/bagels/hard')

      from your tests
